<h2>Myth #2</h2>
<b>Buying local absolves me of reducing my carbon footprint</b>
<h2>Fact #2</h2>
<b>Buying local slightly reduces carbon footprint, but switching to an alternative food item can bring more meaningful change</b>
<h2>Myth #3</h2>
<b>Fruit and Vegetables always generate less carbon footprint compared to Meat</b>
<h2>Fact #3</h2>
<b>Not always, out of season fruit and vegetables need to be transported from distant location resulting in higher environmental impact </b>
<h2>Myth #4</h2>

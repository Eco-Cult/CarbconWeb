			<h4>Raise Awareness </h4>		
		<p>Our website provides a reality check to people about their habits and perceptions of food and its culture. With each decision we make with our intake, our debt to the environment is affected via carbon footprint. Helping people realize this link can bring about a true change.</p>		
			<h4>Our Drive</h4>		
		<p>We are a team of environment-conscious, carbon emission-free driven students who are committed to making an ecological change towards our food practices. Our project is about informing people of their carbon impact of food and helping them reduce it through recommendation.&nbsp;</p>

			<h1>What Is Food Carbon Footprint?</h1>		
		<p><b>Food Carbon Footprint is a term to describe the environmental impact of food production and processing activity. It is measured as the amount of  greenhouse gases (CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O))  emitted into the atmosphere</b></p><p> </p>

			<h1><b>hover your pointer over the following activities to discover the environmental impact OF food production?</b></h1>		
			<h2>Land Use</h2>		
		<p>Twice as many emissions result from land use for livestock (16%) as for crops for human consumption (8%). Agricultural expansion results in the conversion of forests, grasslands and other carbon 'sinks' into cropland or pasture resulting in carbon dioxide emissions</p><p> </p>		
			<h2>ANImAL FEED AND FARM</h2>		
		<p>In Australia, direct livestock emissions account for about 70% of greenhouse gas emissions by the agricultural sector and 11% of total national greenhouse gas emissions. This makes Australia’s livestock the third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions after the energy and transport sectors.                           </p>		
			<h2>Processing and transport</h2>		
		<p>Transport emissions involved as in transporting food from producers in your area. Transport is a contributor to the food carbon emissions. For most food products, it accounts for around 10% of the carbon emission.                                                                         </p><p>                  </p>		
			<h2>packaging and retail</h2>		
		<p>Packaging plays an important role in protecting food from damage and contamination, and extends the useful life of food items on the retail shelf and at home, thus potentially reducing wasted food and its environmental impacts. </p><p> </p>
